The style guide I used for this project is The Tidyverse Style Guide where I used styler for compliance to the style.

This project was about comparing the export data of US Aerospace and Defense to specific metrics of those countries. The major conclusion I made on a large scale is that a further analysis of data country-by-country might be fruitful as on a large scale there was not a general trend. One conclusion I make with confidence however is that air pollution is likely to not have a relationship with the value in USD that countries import in US Aerospace and Defense.
